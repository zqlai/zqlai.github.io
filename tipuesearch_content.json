{"pages":[{"title":"About","text":"I am a postdoctoral fellow at EMBL - EBI in Anton Enright's research group . I initially trained as a molecular biologist with a specialization in genomics and epigenetics. After my PhD defence in 2012, I had the opportunity to create a small research team in my PhD lab Atlantic Gene Therapy . I quickly started to rely on NGS methods to decipher molecular fate of AAV , a virus widely used in gene therapy. When I faced my inability to analyse NGS data, I decided to go back to school to learn bioinformatics. In 2014, I obtained a master degree in bioinformatics and learned to develop NGS pipelines using Python, Bash, R and C in Richard Redon's Bioinformatics group . I stayed in Atlantic Gene therapies as a computational biologist until the end of 2015. After a short humanitarian break in Nepal where I volunteered in a school ( Victor Hugo Manjushree Vidyapith ), I obtained an EIPOD postdoctoral fellowship (Marie Curie/ EMBL ) and joined Anton Enright's team in EMBL - EBI . I am now trying to understand the role of RNA modifications ( epitranscriptomics ) in long non coding RNA (lncRNA) functional and structural role.","tags":"pages","url":"/about.html"},{"title":"contact me","text":"I am a postdoctoral fellow at EMBL - EBI in Anton Enright's research group .
