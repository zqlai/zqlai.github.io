![Me]({filename}/images/avatar_small.png)

I am a postdoctoral fellow at EMBL-EBI in [Anton Enright's research group](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/enright).

I initially trained as a molecular biologist with a specialization in genomics and epigenetics. After my PhD defence in 2012, I had the opportunity to create a small research team in my PhD lab [Atlantic Gene Therapy](http://www.atlantic-gene-therapies.fr/en/). I quickly started to rely on NGS methods to decipher molecular fate of AAV, a virus widely used in gene therapy. When I faced my inability to analyse NGS data, I decided to go back to school to learn bioinformatics. In 2014, I obtained a master degree in bioinformatics and learned to develop NGS pipelines using Python, Bash, R and C in [Richard Redon's Bioinformatics group](http://www.sfrsante.univ-nantes.fr/07305895/0/fiche___pagelibre/&RH=IFR26). I stayed in Atlantic Gene therapies as a computational biologist until the end of 2015. After a short humanitarian break in Nepal where I volunteered in a school ([Victor Hugo Manjushree Vidyapith](https://vhmavi.wordpress.com/)), I obtained an EIPOD postdoctoral fellowship (Marie Curie/EMBL) and joined Anton Enright's team in EMBL-EBI. I am now trying to understand the role of RNA modifications ([epitranscriptomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitranscriptomics)) in long non coding RNA (lncRNA) functional and structural role.
